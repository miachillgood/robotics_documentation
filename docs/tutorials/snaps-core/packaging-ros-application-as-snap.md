# Tutorial 1: Packaging our first ROS application as a snap

Robotics developers know app development inside-out,
but deploying a robotics application can be challenging.
It's not uncommon to compile the code on robots,
copy/paste compiled packages and end up with unknown versions of software.
Even worse, one can experience the infamous “It works on my machine” syndrome.

Robotics software should benefit from a controlled and stable environment,
with the same portability and reliability as any other software application.
Achieving this reliability should be simple,
even if our software relies on hundreds of dependencies.

## What we will learn

This developer guide will take us through the process of
packaging our first ROS application as a snap.

Snaps offer a solution to build and
distribute containerized robotics applications or any software.
It is the de-facto distribution tool for companies deploying software on Ubuntu,
including `Microsoft`, `Google`, `Spotify` and more.
As such, we will be able to leverage the same tooling and
global infrastructure for our application.

Throughout this developer guide,
we will cover the basics of snap creation for ROS and ROS 2 applications.
By introducing the main concepts behind snaps,
we will see how to confine our robotics application and
make it installable on dozens of Linux distributions.

## Requirements

We will need an up and running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar operating system.

``` {note}
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS should be the minimum version as it is still actively maintained.
The installation could be native or in a VM.
If using a container, we must be sure that we can install and run systemd,
snapd and snaps.
```

In addition, we will need basic knowledge about ROS or ROS 2 as well as
some basic understanding of the Linux environment (Ubuntu).

This developer guide has been tailored for robotics developers looking for
a solution to deploy their robotics software and applications.
No previous experience with snaps is necessary.

## What is a snap?

[Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/docs) are the perfect solution for
software deployment in embedded Linux devices.

Snaps are containers that bundle an application and all its dependencies,
offering `roboticists`:

* **A containerized solution**: snaps bundle all our dependencies and assets in one package,
  making our application installable on dozens of
  Linux distributions and across distro versions.
  We won’t even have to install anything else on our robots’ operating system,
  no dependencies,
  not even [ROS](https://ubuntu.com/robotics/what-is-ros) if we are using it.
* **Strict confinement**: snaps are designed to be [secure and isolated](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/security/snap-confinement/)
  from the underlying system and other applications,
  with [dedicated interfaces](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/)
  to access specific resources of the host machine, or of other snaps.
* **CI/CD integration**: the creation of snaps can be integrated into our CI pipeline,
  making the updates effortless.
* **OTA and delta updates**: snaps can update [automatically and `transactionally`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/manage-updates/),
  making sure the device is never broken.
* **Multi-architecture**: snaps come with a [multi-architecture feature](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/platforms/),
  allowing us to build our snap package for multiple architectures.
* **Managing updates**: snaps can be [updated automatically, or we can control the update](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/manage-updates/)
  options (update hours, update holds, update history).
  It also comes with [multiple release channels](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/how-snaps-work/channels-and-tracks/)
  for role-based access controls and application versioning.
* **Reduce boot time**: We can configure a snap application as a daemon,
  so it starts automatically at boot.

### What can snaps do for our robotics applications?

Snaps are meant to deploy software that has been developed and tested.

Snaps offer a solution to deploy and distribute our software.
It’s an alternative package manager (like APT).
With snaps, we can manage updates and keep track of the version installed on
our robot without ever breaking our installation.
Sharing and deploying our application to all our users or all our devices is made easy.
With snaps, we can seamlessly run an application on
our distro and access the host machine and its resources securely.

As such, a snap is a solution to deploy our robotics applications.

### What can’t snaps do for our robotics applications?

Snaps are not meant for testing and debugging.

Snaps don’t embed our source code.
As such, developers can’t use snaps to test some fresh code.
It’s not a distribution mechanism for early debugging sessions.
On its own, snaps are not meant for cloud web services deployments or
web services applications; i.e. Docker.
Snaps are used in environments where secure access to
the host machine and resources is crucial.

Snaps were designed for embedded Linux applications,
with optimisations for ROS packaging.

## Install snapd, Snapcraft and LXD

### Snapd

*Snapd is a daemon required to download, install and run snaps.
Snapd also includes the snap command, used to communicate with snapd.*

Installing `snapd` is straightforward in most Linux distributions.
`Snapd` comes pre-installed on most  Ubuntu flavours.
In most cases, `snapd` can be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

For different distributions,
we can refer [to the documentation to install `snapd`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/tutorials/install-the-daemon/).

`Snapd` is also available through a snap.
We can get a more recent version of `snapd` with:

```bash
sudo snap install snapd
```

After installing `snapd` you should be able to type in a terminal:

```bash
snap --version
```

A quick look at snap help will show everything that we can do with the snap command

```bash
snap help
```

Commonly used commands can be classified as follows:

```bash
         Basics: find, info, install, remove, list
        ...more: refresh, revert, switch, disable, enable, create-cohort
        History: changes, tasks, abort, watch
        Daemons: services, start, stop, restart, logs
    Permissions: connections, interface, connect, disconnect
  Configuration: get, set, unset, wait
    App Aliases: alias, aliases, unalias, prefer
        Account: login, logout, whoami
      Snapshots: saved, save, check-snapshot, restore, forget
         Device: model, reboot, recovery
      ... Other: warnings, okay, known, ack, version
    Development: download, pack, run, try
```

### Snapcraft

While `snapd` is used to download and run snaps,
`snapcraft` is the tool we need to build snaps.

If we installed Snapcraft as a `.deb` package previously, we will have to uninstall it,
the Debian package is no longer updated.
To do so, just run: `sudo apt remove snapcraft --purge`

To install Snapcraft simply run:

```bash
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```

The `--classic` flag refers to the confinement.
We will address the confinement topic later in this guide.

`Snapcraft` is not only a tool to build snaps, but more generally a developer tool,
meaning that we will use it to build, upload and share our snaps.

### LXD

[`LXD`](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/)
is the container technology used by snapcraft to isolate our snap build.
`LXD` is not only dedicated to snaps.
It’s a next generation system container and virtual machine manager.

LXD can be installed with a snap and must be configured to be used.
To install LXD simply run:

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
```

Now that `LXD` is installed, we must configure it.
We are going to use a default profile to do so:

```bash
sudo lxd init --auto
```

We can make sure everything went well by listing the profiles and
making sure the default profile is listed:

```bash
$ lxc profile list
+---------+---------------------+---------+
| NAME    | DESCRIPTION         | USED BY |
+---------+---------------------+---------+
| default | Default LXD profile | 0       |
+---------+---------------------+---------+
```

## First `ROS 2` snap

Our first snap will be a basic ROS 2 Humble talker-listener.
We are going to use [`ros2_demos: demo_nodes_cpp`](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble/demo_nodes_cpp).
It contains a talker publishing a message and a listener subscribing to it.
Both nodes can be launched with the help of the
[`talker_listener.launch.py`](https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/humble/demo_nodes_cpp/launch/topics/talker_listener.launch.py).

### Understanding the `snapcraft.yaml` file

First clone the package
[from GitHub](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2-humble-talker-listener-snap.git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2-humble-talker-listener-snap.git
```

The repository contains a snap folder with a `snapcraft.yaml` file.
Snaps are defined in a single `YAML` file placed in our project.
Let’s explore our
[`snapcraft.yaml`](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2-humble-talker-listener-snap/blob/main/snap/snapcraft.yaml)
and break it down in the next section:

### Metadata

The `snapcraft.yaml` file starts with a small amount of human-readable metadata,
which usually can be lifted from the GitHub description or project `README.md`.
This data is used in the presentation of our app in the Snap Store
(for example, see [PlotJuggler front page](https://snapcraft.io/plotjuggler)).

```yaml
name: ros2-talker-listener
version: '0.1'
summary: ROS 2 Talker/Listener Example
description: |
    This example launches a ROS 2 talker and listener.
```

The `name` must be unique in the Snap Store in case we later want to publish it.
Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
They cannot be all numbers, and they cannot start or end with a hyphen.

This is a declarative `version` of the packaged software and
is not linked to the version of the snap software itself.
It’s also possible to write a script to calculate the version,
or to take a tag or commit from a git repository.

The `summary` cannot exceed 79 characters.

* For more information about core versions,
  please see [top-level-metadata](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/snapcraft-yaml/).

### Base

Next in the `YAML` file we will find the `base` keyword.
This defines a special kind of snap that provides a run-time environment with a
minimal set of libraries that are common to most applications.
They’re transparent to users, but they need to be considered,
and specified, when building a snap.
As snap developers, we should consider it,
but our users will be able to install the final snap independently of their OS version.

```yaml
base: core22
```

[core22](https://snapcraft.io/core22) is the current standard base for snap
building and
is based on [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/).
It is therefore the base for ROS 2 Humble snaps.

* For more information about core versions, please refer to the
  [Snapcraft `base` documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/how-to/crafting/specify-a-base/).

### Security model

Following, we will see the `confinement` keyword.
Snaps are containerized to ensure predictable application behaviour and
to provide greater security.
We will [review this topic](#confinement-types) later in this guide.

To get started, we won’t confine this application.
Unconfined applications are specified with `devmode`.

```yaml
confinement: devmode
```

### Parts

`Parts` follow next.
They define how to build our app and can be anything: programs, libraries,
or other assets needed to create and run our application.
Their source can be local directories, remote git repositories, or tarballs.
Multiple `parts` can be defined within the same `snapcraft.yaml` in order to
build dependencies or even an additional application.

In this example, we have a single part: ‘`ros-demos`’.

```yaml
parts:
  ros-demos:
    plugin: colcon
    source: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git
    source-branch: humble
    source-subdir: demo_nodes_cpp
    stage-packages: [ros-humble-ros2launch]
```

Snapcraft relies on well known and well established ROS tools such as,
in this example, [`colcon`](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/plugins/colcon_plugin/).
[Plugins](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/plugins/)
allow us to identify such tools.

The packages we’re building must have `install` rules,
or else Snapcraft won’t know which components to place into the snap.
We should make sure we install binaries, libraries, header files, launch files, etc.
Here, we selected the `humble` branch of
[ros2-demos GitHub repository](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble) as `source-branch`.
Since `ros2-demos` contains multiple packages,
we select `demo_nodes_cpp` with the `source-subdir` entry.

We notice that `ros-humble-ros2launch` is listed as a `stage-packages`.
Stage packages are packages required to run the `part`.
Usually this exec dependency is missing from the `package.xml` hence we must
specify it.
The rest of the dependencies are going to be
automatically downloaded with `rosdep` based on the `package.xml`.

* For more information about general parts metadata,
  see [parts-metadata](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/snapcraft-yaml/index.html).

* For more information about plugins,
  please refer to the [Snapcraft documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/plugins/).

### Apps

After `parts` we find the `apps` keyword.
These are the commands and services exposed to end users.

```yaml
apps:
  ros2-talker-listener:
    command: opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 launch demo_nodes_cpp talker_listener.launch.py
    extensions: [ros2-humble]
```

The entry under apps is the app name that should be exposed to the end users.
In our case the app name is `ros2-talker-listener`.

In snap, an application is usually prefixed by the snap name so that
the application `my-app` from the snap `my-snap` can be executed by calling `my-snap.my-app`.
However, if both the snap and the app are called the same,
as is the case in our ROS 2 example,
the execution command collapses to avoid the tediousness of writing twice the same words.

As a result, the command `ros2-talker-listener.ros2-talker-listener`
simply becomes `ros2-talker-listener`.
We will see this when we run the snap.

Multiple apps can be defined within the same `snapcraft.yaml`.
Our snap will then expose multiple commands.
Then, after the `app` name, we find the `command` entry.
This specifies the path to the binary to be run, along with arguments.
This is resolved relative to the root of
our snap contents (hence there is no ‘`/`’ before `opt`).

Finally, the [`ros2-humble extension`](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/extensions/ros-2-extensions/)
will set our ROS 2 humble build and runtime environment.
This way we don’t have to source manually our ROS 2 environment.

* For more information about ROS extensions,
please refer to the [Snapcraft documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/extensions/).

## Building, installing and running a snap

Now that our `snapcraft.yaml` is ready, we will describe how to build our package.
In this section, we will also cover how to install and run the created snap.

### Building

The file `snapcraft.yaml` is expected to be found in the `snap/` directory.
So the `snapcraft` command is expected to be run at the root of
our repository where we can find the `snap/` directory.
The `snapcraft` command is going to look for `snap/snapcraft.yaml` and
start building our snap.

Snapcraft is building the snap in steps:

1. **pull**: downloads or otherwise retrieves the components needed to build the part.
2. **build**: constructs the part from the previously pulled components.
   The [plugin](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/plugins/)
   of a part specifies how it is constructed.
3. **stage**: copies the built components into the staging area.
   This is the first time all the different parts that make up the snap are
   actually placed in the same directory.
4. **prime**: copies the staged components into the priming area,
   to their final locations for the resulting snap.
   This is very similar to the stage step,
   but files go into the priming area instead of the staging area.
   The prime step exists because the staging area might still contain files that
   are required for the build but not for the snap.

To build our snap, we will run:

```bash
snapcraft pack
```

This will take some time, but once it’s done we will see:

```bash
Created snap package ros2-talker-listener_0.1_amd64.snap
```

This `.snap` file is our packaged application.

### Installing

If we could install `snapd` on our current distribution,
it means that we can install our freshly built snap.
We don’t need to be running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to run this ROS 2 Humble snap.
We don’t even need to install ROS on our host system to install and run the snap.

Snaps bundle all their dependencies as well as their “`core`” which make them host-agnostic.

Since our snap is currently not confined, we will install it with the flag `--devmode`.

```bash
sudo snap install ros2-talker-listener_0.1_amd64.snap --devmode
```

### Running the snap

Now let’s run the snap that we just installed.

We can start the snap by running:

```bash
ros2-talker-listener
```

We will see the talker listener starting to exchange messages.
We can then `ctrl-c` it to stop it.
Note that we built,
installed and ran this ROS application without even installing ROS 2 on our host.

In this example, our snap has only one app,
but snap can contain as many applications (commands) as we need.
We can easily get info on our installed snap with the snap info command:

```bash
$ snap info ros2-talker-listener

name:      ros2-talker-listener
summary:   ROS 2 Talker/Listener Example
publisher: –
license:   unset
description: |
  This example launches a ROS 2 talker and listener.
Commands:
  - ros2-talker-listener
refresh-date: today at 10:54 CEST
installed:    0.1 (x1) 64MB devmode
```

We can see all kinds of metadata as well as the commands available from the snap.

## Confining our first snap application

Our application was installed in `devmode`.
This means that our snap can access every resource
from our host system (files, devices, etc.).
For security,
snaps are meant to be run and distributed as strictly confined applications.

In this section we will explore the confinement types,
grades and interfaces available.
Then, we will strictly confine our application.

## Confinement types

So far, in our `snapcraft.yaml`, we only declared:

```yaml
confinement: devmode
```

Let’s have a closer look at the types of confinement:

* **Devmode**

  A special mode for snap creators and developers.
  A `devmode` snap runs as a strictly confined snap with full access to system resources,
  and produces debug output to identify unspecified interfaces.
  Installation requires the `--devmode` command line argument.

* **Classic**

  Allows access to our system’s resources in much the same way traditional packages do.
  To safeguard against abuse, publishing a classic snap requires
  [manual approval](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/administration/reviewing-classic-confinement-snaps/),
  and installation requires the `--classic` command line argument.
  The typical applications allowed with classic confinement are IDEs (VS Code, Qt Creator).

* **Strict**

  Used by the majority of snaps.
  Strictly confined snaps run in complete isolation,
  up to a minimal access level that’s deemed always safe.
  Consequently, strictly confined snaps can not access our files, network,
  processes or any other system resource without
  requesting specific access via an interface.

In this case, our application should be confined as strict since
we want to be able to share it securely.
Everything it needs to access can be declared through interfaces.
Let’s make that change:

```yaml
confinement: strict
```

* For more information about security models, please see
  [choosing security models](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/explanation/snapcraft-yaml/index.html#confinement).

### Grade

By adding the `grade` keyword, we can declare the quality of our snap.
By defining the grade,
we can make sure that a development version never goes into a stable channel.

There are only two grades possible:

* #### `Devel`

  A `devel` snap indicates that this is a development version,
  and it is not meant to be released on either a stable or candidate channel.

* #### Stable

  The default one.
  Meant for production grade snaps, so it can later be released to every user.

For this example, let’s add the grade keyword and select `stable`:

```yaml
grade: stable
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces enable resources from one snap to be shared with another or with the system.
An interface consists of a connection between a slot and a plug.
The slot is the provider of the interface while the plug is the consumer,
and a slot can support multiple plug connections.

The list of available interfaces is available on the
[online documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/).
We can find interfaces to access the home directory, the CANBus, the network etc.

The interfaces to use are declared in the `snapcraft.yaml` for each application.
In the online documentation,
we will see that some interfaces are listed as “`auto-connect=yes`” and some are not.
The auto-connectable interface will connect at the installation of the snap,
while the others will have to be connected manually.
This resembles the security validation of an app requesting permissions to
the user to access some resources.

Which interfaces a snap requires, and provides,
is very much dependent on the type of snap and its own requirements.

For our ROS 2 snap, we will need two auto-connect interfaces:
`network` to enable network access and `network-bind` to
let our snap operate as a network service.

```yaml
plugs: [network, network-bind]
```

* For more information about interfaces,
please see the [online documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/supported-interfaces).

## Confining and rebuilding our snap

By changing the confinement level and adding the `grade` and `plugs`,
in our `snapcraft.yaml`.
We will confine our application.

We can find the updated code from the
[confined branch](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2-humble-talker-listener-snap/tree/confined).

To switch to the confined branch:

```bash
git switch confined
```

Our `snapcraft.yaml` file should have these modifications:

```yaml
-confinement: devmode
+confinement: strict
+grade: stable
apps:
  ros2-talker-listener:
  command: opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 launch talker-listener talker_listener.launch.py
+ plugs: [network, network-bind]
```

Once our changes are done, let’s rebuild our snap:

```bash
snapcraft pack
```

This time our snap is confined, so we don’t need the `--devmode` flag any more.
Yet, we will need the `--dangerous` flag,
since our snap hasn’t been
[signed by an official store](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/how-to/publishing/publish-a-snap/).

To install our snap:

```bash
sudo snap install ros2-talker-listener_0.1_amd64.snap --dangerous
```

Let’s check the connections of our freshly confined snap.
Run:

```bash
$ snap connections ros2-talker-listener

Interface    Plug                              Slot          Notes
network     ros2-talker-listener:network       :network      -
network-bind ros2-talker-listener:network-bind :network-bind -
```

In the above output,
we can see that our snap is connected to the network and network-bind slot.

If everything looks good, let’s run our confined snap:

```bash
ros2-talker-listener
```

We will now face this log:

```{terminal}
[talker-1] 2022-07-13 15:47:10.570 [RTPS_TRANSPORT_SHM Error] Failed to create segment cbbe40933e75c60a: Permission denied -> Function compute_per_allocation_extra_size

[listener-2] [INFO] [1657720032.730571444] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 2]
```

The error that we see is related to the
[shared memory transport not being able to create its file](https://ubuntu.com/robotics/docs/ros-2-shared-memory-in-snaps).
This is expected.
We will cover how to manage shared memory in our snaps later.
For now, even with the shared memory failing,
ROS 2 falls back to network transport (UDP) and messages are properly sent and received.

Apart from our shared memory error message,
our snap is now running strictly confined with only access to our network.

## Run our snap as a daemon

One of the advantages of using snaps is that they can turn our application into a
[service (or a daemon)](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/control-services/)
in an incredibly easy way.
Once we have turned our application into a service,
it can automatically start at boot and end when the machine is shut down.
We can also start and stop on demand through socket activation.

A daemon can take different forms, where the first two daemons are the most used forms:

* **simple**: Run for as long as the service is active -
  this is typically the default option.
* **oneshot**: Run once and exit after completion, notifying systemd.
* **forking**: The configured command calls fork() as part of its start-up,
  and the parent process is then expected to exit when start-up is complete.
* **notify**: Assumes the command will send a signal to systemd to
  indicate its running state.

The daemon feature is per command and not per snap.
This means that one snap containing multiple commands can
have some running as daemon and
others running as simple commands.

To turn our [talker-publisher into a simple daemon](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2-humble-talker-listener-snap/tree/daemon),
we will add `daemon: simple` in our `snapcraft.yaml`.

```diff
apps:
  ros2-talker-listener:
    command: opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 launch talker-listener talker_listener.launch.py
+   daemon: simple
    plugs: [network, network-bind]
    extensions: [ros2-humble]
```

That’s it.
To switch to this version of the file run:

```bash
git switch daemon
```

Now let’s rebuild and install our snap.
The build should be quicker as this has been done before.

```bash
snapcraft pack
sudo snap install ros2-talker-listener_0.1_amd64.snap --dangerous
```

Let’s explore what happens now that we have turned our snap application into a daemon.

First, we get some info about our snap:

```bash
$ snap info ros2-talker-listener

name: ros2-talker-listener
summary: ROS 2 Talker/Listener Example
publisher: –
license: unset
description: |
  This example launches a ROS 2 talker and listener.
services:
  ros2-talker-listener: simple, enabled, active
refresh-date: today at 16:39 CEST
installed: 0.1 (x9) 64MB -
```

Our command is now listed as a service and marked enabled and active.
This means that our `talker-listener` is currently running as a daemon.

`Active` means the talker-listener is now running in the background.
And enabled means that it will automatically start at boot and
restart in case of failure.

## Log our service

We can inspect the log of our running service with the `snap` tool.
To inspect our snap log run:

```bash
$ sudo snap logs ros2-talker-listener

ros2-talker-listener.ros2-talker-listener[970635]: [talker-1] [INFO] [1657724117.996643358] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 957'

```

We can also add the `-f` flag if we want to wait for new lines and
print them as they come in.

Snap logs are actually available in the `systemd` journal.
Hence, we can log a snap service directly from the `journalctl` command:

```bash
journalctl -fu snap.ros2-talker-listener.ros2-talker-listener.service
```

(`-f` for follow and `-u` to show the log of our specific unit)

## Interact with our service

We saw that our service was enabled and active,
we can obviously interact with these states.

In case we want to temporarily stop our service, we can by using running:

```bash
sudo snap stop ros2-talker-listener
```

We have stopped our service, so it’s no longer running in the background.
But if we reboot, our service will still start automatically.
This is because our service is still enabled.

To disable our service, we can do it with:

```bash
sudo snap stop --disable ros2-talker-listener
```

Now our service won’t start again.
We can verify the result of our actions by running the `snap info` command on our snap.

We have seen how to stop/disable our service,
but of course we also have the corresponding start/enable command.

## Conclusion

In this developer guide, we went through the creation of a basic ROS 2 snap.
But in the process, we learned the basics to create our own ROS snap as well.
We have covered the basic concepts of a snap, how to build and run them.
We also shared the benefits and good development practices.
There are more features and advanced development tips that we have yet to cover.
The [turtlebot3 snap example](https://ubuntu.com/blog/how-to-set-up-turtlebot3-in-minutes-with-snaps)
shows how we can use snap to make your robot software easily installable.
